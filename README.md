# Portfolio Website with Admin Backend (React + Express + MongoDB)

This is a full-stack portfolio project that allows the user (Rutul Manani) to showcase projects and skills on a React-based frontend, with dynamic content managed via a Node.js + Express backend connected to MongoDB. An admin dashboard allows full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on both projects and skills.
